description: Update hamburger menu links consistently across all pages.
---

Task: Update the slide-out hamburger menu across `index.html`, `json-beautifier.html`, and `html-renderer.html`.

Rules:
- Keep the existing menu structure and data attributes.
- Ensure each page sets `aria-current="page"` only on its own link.
- Preserve the order of links unless explicitly requested.
- Do not change styling tokens.

Deliverable:
- A single consistent nav list across pages.
